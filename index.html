          Being a huge fan of the show I wanted to make a trivia game homage to
          it. So here it is my Bob's Burgers trivia click and play game. All
          pictures are from bobs-burgers.fandom.com/ and all gifs are from
          Giphy.com. This is a general knowledge round of 10. There is also a
          character names only quiz in the works. There are 5 different ending
          gifs based on your score. Just pick which version you'd rather try
          below.
          <br /><br />
          Answer 10 multiple-choice questions to see if you're a true fan of the
          show or just a passing fart sound from Gene's keyboard. The end gif's
          are the same for both versions but tied to your score.

          Bob's Burgers is an animated show on the Fox network that first aired
          January 9th, 2011. It was created by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Bouchard" target="_blank"
            >Loren Bouchard</a
          >
          and currently airs on Fox Sunday night as part of their 'Animation
          Domination' programming. The show revolves around Bob Belcher a
          middle-aged father who runs Bob's Burgers a restaurant they live above
          with his family comprised of his wife Linda and their three children
          Tina, Gene, and Louise. The running jokes of a different exterminator
          and business next door in the opening credits of the show harkens back
          to the joy of the Simpson's chalkboard gag from its intro. There is a
          movie coming out this year for the show also. To learn more about here
